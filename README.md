# Avito Demand Prediction Challenge: open solution

This is an open solution to the [Avito Demand Prediction Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-demand-prediction).

## The goal
Create (entirely) open solution to this competition. We are opening not only the code, but also the process of creating it. Rules are simple:
* Clean code and extendable solution are - in the long run - much better than current public LB position
* This solution should - by itself - establish solid benchmark, as well as provide good base for your custom ideas and experiments.

## Installation
*coming soon*
